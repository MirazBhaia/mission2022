            This year my mission is to become a web developer. I started last
            year, but I was not very disciplined. For that reason, I was not
            able to progress. But I have decided that I need to work harder
            regularly because I want to claim myself a full-stack web developer.

              This year my mission is to become a web developer. No matter what
              it cost! I will try my best to achieve this target. I believe I
              can do it.

              As I want to become a web developer, my vision is I will be a
              front-end web developer by this year. I should get a job as well
              and then learn the back-end. I want to call myself a full-stack
              web developer by the end of 2023.

              I have a couple of goals too. Such as I want to work in an online
              marketplace as a freelancer, own an IT firm. I should get a job
              abroad, oh yes! that would be nice.

            If coding is fun, development with coding is much more than that.
            But you can't feel that if you code with limitations. To feel the
            power of raw coding, one shouldn't be afraid of anything.
